This C++ project, as well as the Word document of pseudocode, was about importing data from a file, storing it using an appropriate structure, and then manipulating, seaching and outputting the file as needed. The data in this case was a list of courses, each of while had a course number and name, and potentially up to 2 prerequisite courses, with each course being one line in the data file, with each field being comma-seperated.
The pseudocode in the Word document represents three different data structures that could have been used: a vector, a hash table or a binary seach tree, and evaluates the benefits and drawbacks of each option. Given the fairly low amount of data involved in this problem, the vector solution was the one chosen and represented in the C++ code file. In other circumstances, the vector option might be a poor choice. There's no one-size-fits-all solution for choosing the best data structure: it depends on the requirements of the problem being evaluated. 
There weren't any significant roadblocks in programming this scenario. The only item that was particularly confusing was what appeared to be some unncesssary 'garbage' data at the beginning of the provided data file, which was resolved by adding a function to trim off non-alphanumeric characters when importing data. This project/class helped improve my knowledge of different data structures, which will help make it easier to make a good choice when considering problems in the future.
